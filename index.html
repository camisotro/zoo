		<h2>Keeping Portland Weird</h2>
		<p>Portland, Oregon's reputation for being purposefully "weird" has in recent years seen a lot of publicity due to the comedy TV show <u>Portlandia</u>. Contrary to its name, zoobombing does not involve any sort of explosives or animals. <strong>Zoobombing</strong> is a phenomenon unique to Portland. </p>
		<p>What it does involve is a unique combination of human-powered transportation, public transit and geography. Portland's MAX rail system issues proof-of-payment transfers that last 2.5 hours and can be used for as many trips as desired during that time.</p>

		<p>Every Sunday, "Zoobombers" meet up at a sculpture called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Bike_Library_of_Portland">People's Bike Library of Portland</a> located at SW 13th and Burnside. A collection of miniature bikes are made available to participants, or they can bring their own. Riders purchase a MAX rail ticket and ride to the underground Washington Park station, where they disembark and take a 26-storey elevator journey to the surface. From here, groups of riders coast down a number of different trails, often "bombing" down the hill at high speeds. Upon arriving back downtown, riders can board the MAX again on the same rail ticket and repeat the adventure several times.</p>

		<h2>Cycling in Portland</h2>
		<p>Portland's mild West Coast weather is a perfect fit for a city with over 300 miles of bicycle routes, including bike lanes, greenways and off-street paths.</p>
		<p>The MAX rail system has convenient bicycle racks for multimodal trips. Portland's downtown terrain is mostly flat, but the city's west side borders on the Tualatin Mountains. The Oregon Zoo is located in Washington Park which sits at an elevation of up to 870 feet above sea level.</p>
